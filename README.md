# Introduction

This project is part of the course GPU computing @ECAM - Brussels Engineering School.

## The project

In this projet I will create the simulation of a cloth in Rust.

I will use a Compute Shader to update the positions and velocities of the vertices of the cloth. My simulation will have to detect collisions between the cloth and a sphere and make the cloth react in a realistic way.

The cloth geometry and the springs connectivity will be generated by Rust code on the CPU. The simulation must run on the GPU with a Compute Shader. Simulations parameters must come from the Rust code via an Uniform Buffer.

## Result

The simulation runs pretty smoothly although it's missing frictional forces (between the particles and the sphere) and the textures.
